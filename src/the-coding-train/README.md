## The Coding Train
In this special section of my digital playground, we delve into the magical world of creative coding, drawing inspiration from the boundless creativity of [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman), whom I deeply admire.

As a big fan of [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), I've set out on a mission to tackle the playful challenges Daniel presents with my own twist. From crafting mesmerizing visual patterns with not only p5.js or Proccessing, but new technologies and graphics engine to building interactive animations, this space is a celebration of experimentation and imagination.

Here, I'm not just writing code; I'm exploring new horizons, pushing the limits of what's possible, and, most importantly, having a great time along the way!
